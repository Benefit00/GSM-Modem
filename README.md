GSM-Modem
=========

Project to interact with a GSM modem through USB port that has 16 serial ports in the modem.

I am needing to interact with a 16 port GSM modem that connects via USB cable.

The project is designed to handle SMS sending and receiving to the device via any of the 16 ports.
The program should also handle receiving and dialing of phone calls, as well as being able to dial USSD codes (part of phoning)
and should the need arise to switch to a data connection for internet use (HSDPA)

This project is purely on design currently and implimentation into code is only just begining.

Thanks for any support with the design.
